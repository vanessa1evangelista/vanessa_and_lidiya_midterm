<h1>This Is Why I Think Snakes Are better Than frogs</h1>

<p> I believe that snakes are far superior to frogs for many reasons. Firstly, they are able to get around with no arms or legs and still manage to move quicker. Plus they feel way cooler when you hold them because they look slimy but they are not at all. People tend to not prefer snakes and reptiles in general because society over time has considered them “dirty” and “pests.”

       <p> Frogs are better than snakes because they come in multiple different colours, like blue,red, green,yellow and brown. Frogs are small and they won't bite you because they are only attracted to flies and small insects. Frogs are the better animal. Frogs are the best.</p>

<h3>I see your point, but you wrong!</h3>
<p>I completely disagree with Vanessa's point because snakes come in many different colors as well. Frogs also have a history of biting humans, although they don't have fangs ( which is literally awesome)  they still can leave a nasty bite depending on the size and type of frog.
