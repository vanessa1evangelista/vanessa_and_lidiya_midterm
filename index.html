<h1> This is why I think Frogs Are Better Than Snakes</h1>
    <header>
       <p> Frogs are better than snakes because they come in multiple different colours, like blue,red, green,yellow and brown. Frogs are small and they won't bite you because they are only attracted to flies and small insects. Frogs are the better animal. Frogs are the best.</p>

    <h3>This is why i disagree</h3>
    <p>I disagree with her point because frogs are the easiest animals to keep as pets and frogs feel cooler when you hold them because theyâ€™re slimy and slippery. </p>
