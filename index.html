<h1>This Is Why I Think Snakes Are better Than frogs</h1>

<p> I believe that snakes are far superior to frogs for many reasons. Firstly, they are able to get around with no arms or legs and still manage to move quicker. Plus they feel way cooler when you hold them because they look slimy but they are not at all. People tend to not prefer snakes and reptiles in general because society over time has considered them “dirty” and “pests.”
