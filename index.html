<h1> This is why I think Frogs Are Better Than Snakes</h1>
    <header>
       <p> Frogs are better than snakes because they come in multiple different colours, like blue,red, green,yellow and brown. Frogs are small and they won't bite you because they are only attracted to flies and small insects. Frogs are the better animal. Frogs are the best.</p>
